debug notes:

- time 'freezes' after a certain point sometimes (dt = const, no movement of water)
  - This could be because of friction overcoming inertial forces?
- outlet doesn't work properly. Need to think of a physically sensible way of implementing
- visualise by fixed timestep rather than iteration?
